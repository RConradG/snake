# Snake

Snake is a video game with a rich history. Created in 1976 and originally
titled Blockade, this simple, monochromatic video game started as a competitive
two player game. One player needed to survive longer than the other player. The game
underwent several versions,from 3-d but the mobile version played on the Nokia mobile
phone greatly popularized the game. It is said to have been installed on 350
million Nokia phones at one point, which, despite it's simplicity, solidified 
Snake's place as one of the most popular video games.

## What does this Snake version do?

My one-player version of Snake is quite simple. By using the arrow keys on the 
keyboard, the player controls a "snake" to eat food, elongating as it eats.

The player earns 10 points every time the snake eats. The game also displays the
score and high score that allow the player to keep track of the total points 
earned prior to the game ending, and the highest score earned throughout
the gaming session, respectively.

The snake cannot hit the walls of the game board nor eat itself. If either occurs,
the game ends. The player has the option of restarting the game, and to reiterate,
the highest score is kept until the user refreshes the browser, or closes the
browser and starts a brand new session by clicking the link to the game.

## Why Snake?

I chose to create a version of snake for several reasons. For one, I wanted to
learn how to make a simple video game. Secondly, I enjoy playing retro games,
and I thought it would be incredible to create my own version. Lastly, I wanted
to challenge myself and grow from the difficulties of creating a video game. 

## Getting Started

Here is the link to the game.

To start the game, press any arrow key.

The arrow keys are also used to control the snake. So, there are only four keys
the player uses:
- Up Arrow
- Down Arrow
- Left Arrow
- Right Arrow

If the game ends, the player can restart the game by clicking the restart button.

## Next Steps

I plan on adding additional features and functionality in the future. I would 
like to add different food elements for the snake to eat and snake "heads."
I would also like to add different game modes that increase in difficulty, where
the velocity of the snake increase as the game mode increases in difficulty.
