#  🐍 Snake 🐍 

🐍 Snake 🐍 is a video game with a rich history. Created in 1976 and originally
titled "Blockade," this simple, monochromatic video game started as a competitive
two player game. One player needed to survive longer than the other player. The game
underwent several versions,from 2-3 to 3-d, but the mobile version played on Nokia
mobile phones popularized the game. It is said to have been installed on 350
million Nokia phones at one point, which, despite it's simplicity, solidified 
🐍  Snake 🐍 's place as one of the most popular video games.

# What does this 🐍 Snake 🐍 version do?

My one-player version of 🐍 Snake 🐍 is quite simple. By using the arrow keys on the 
keyboard, the player controls a "🐍 Snake 🐍" to eat food, and the snake elongates as it eats.

The player earns 10 points every time the 🐍 Snake 🐍 eats. The game also displays the
score and high score that allows the player to keep track of the total points 
earned prior to the game ending and the highest score earned throughout
the gaming session, respectively.

The 🐍 Snake 🐍 cannot hit the walls of the game board nor eat itself. If either occurs,
the game ends. The player has the option of restarting the game, and to reiterate,
the highest score is kept until the user refreshes the browser, or closes the
browser and starts a brand new session by clicking the link to the game.

# Why 🐍 Snake 🐍?

I chose to create a version of 🐍 Snake 🐍 for several reasons. For one, I wanted to
learn how to make a simple video game. Secondly, I enjoy playing retro games,
and I thought it would be incredible to create my own version. Lastly, I wanted
to challenge myself and grow from the difficulties of creating a video game.

# Getting Started

### [Here is the link to the game.](https://rconradg.github.io/snake/)

### [Here is a link to my planning materials](/snake-browser-game-proposal.pdf)

To start the game, press any arrow key.

The arrow keys are also used to change the 🐍 Snake 🐍's direction. So, there are only
four keys the player uses:
- Up Arrow ⬆️
- Down Arrow ⬇️
- Left Arrow ⬅️
- Right Arrow ➡️

👉 If the game ends, the player can restart the game by clicking the restart button. 👈

# Technologies Used

JavaScript, HTML, CSS

# Next Steps

I plan on adding additional features and functionality in the future. I would 
like to add different food elements for the 🐍 Snake 🐍 to eat and 🐍 Snake 🐍 "heads."
I would also like to add different game modes, where the velocity of the 🐍 Snake 🐍
increases as the game mode increases in difficulty.
